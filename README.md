## TIL - Today I Learned


**TLDR:** Here's what I learned every day in 2021.

I got tired of college. I'm not going to get into details but for 2021 I decided to stay away from
it (at least for a year) and try to learn things on my own. To track my progress I created this TIL
repo in which I'll be uploading a markdown file with with all things I learn every day and maybe
stick a little tutorial in them on how I did it.
