### Java and databases day

Trying to configure h2 and being able to launch h2-console. It works form the IDE but not when
launching from the CLI...

After an hour or so I found the command IntelliJ uses to launch the application and 
analyzed it. Took me a while because it's 7000 characters long.
I need to learn more about java's CLASSPATH, but I'm hating it already. It's linking
50 or more .jars

Got h2-console working!

#### How to get h2-console working

 1. Go to [start.spring.io](start.spring.io)
 2. Select dependencies:
    - Spring Boot Devtools
    - Lombok
    - Spring Web
    - Spring Data JPA
    - H2 Database
    - MySQL DRIVER (or the database you are gonna use)
 3. On launch you should be able to access [https://localhost:8080/h2-console](https://localhost:8080/h2-console)
 4. Configure jpa as follows in file `./src/main/resources/application.properties`
    ```
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/schema_name?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
    spring.datasource.username=admin
    spring.datasource.password=admin
    spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
    ```
