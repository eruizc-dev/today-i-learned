# NAS fixing

Windows likes to break every once in a while, so I decided to do a clean install of it. Also I had
too much disk space assigned to it and my main Linux installation had only 3GB left.

First I need to backup. I do have a NAS for that, but it wasn't properly configured so I took on
the challenge.

### My NAS

My NAS is built with spare pieces

 - AMD Athlon x2
 - 6GB DDR3 RAM
 - 2x WD Blue 500GB
 - 1x WD Blue 1TB
 - 2x SanDisk DataTravler 32GB
 - TrueNAS Core

 - SanDisks make raid 1 and store the OS
 - 500's are in raid 0 and work as the main storage
 - 1tb does nothing

### Tasks

 - Set some redundancy, I don't want to loose everything if one of those 500GB drives fail
 - Fix permissions, because my user can't access his home directory
 - Add some sort of backup

### Backup and redundancy

Learned about snapshots and replication. Set up some tasks:

 - Create daily snapshot of (some directories in) the 2 500's (lasts 3 days)
 - Replicate those snapshots daily in the 1TB drive
 - Create weekly snapshots in the 1TB drive (last 3 months)
