### Past days

It's not like I've been doing nothing in the last 5 days, the things is that I'm
not used to writing everything. I learned postman testing, did an integration
project, recovered some data from almost dead drives with gparted, ddrescue,
testdisk.

### Random thoughts

VIM is a philosophy.

MITHS:
 - It's not faster
 - Won't make you more productive

REALITY:
 - It's hard to get started
 - I learn new technologies using other ides (with vim plugins), may take me a month to
 fully migrate into VIM. There are some exceptions, like Rust and Golang, but applies for
 most techs.
 - It's about bing keyboard-centered. Not like there's a big benefit since
 typespeed is not a bottleneck but once you get used to it you get really
 comfortable. With AwesomeWM (tiling window manager) I went from using 3
 physical displays to using 1 and a half. I still have them 3, one is always
 off or in the desktop, the other has 1 or 2 chats in it and the primary one
 has 4 tabs, with 1, 2 or 3 programs open in each.
 - It's about being tech savy, you can customize the heck out of it but it
 requires knowledge ofc. That's why I start with other IDEs before migrating
 into VIM: cuz I need to know a little before being able to do anything. I
 love this, it lest me learn a LOT about how things work and it's just fun
 for me.
