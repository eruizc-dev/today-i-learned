### Java Time!

So today our spring challenge started. We have 3 days to create a RESTful API using Java, Spring
and Springboot. I already learned how to do all of this in the previous clases, so I had an easy
start. What I did learn toady was how to use variables create tests with Postman. I have to admit
it was a lot of fun making changes to the api, runing tests and watching them fail.

It was also the first day I did everything (except project creation) from outside IntelliJ idea.
Just a terminal, Neovim, Maven and JDTLS.
