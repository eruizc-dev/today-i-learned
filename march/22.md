### Monday again

Still consistency issues here...

What did I do these last week?

 - Learned how to do integration tests with Junit
 - Did a challenge on code quality
 - Cleaned my vimrc folder: It once was a giant vimrc, it's cool to have it split
 in multiple little files
 - Went down from 3 to 2 screens: It was distracting! I used to like having 3
 screens but since I started using [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) I don't
 need more than 2. The third was only a distraction.
 - I'm considering getting a new Wallet... Probably a
 [Walla Wallet](https://www.wallawallets.com/Billeteras/), idk.
