### SQL day!

So... We had to install MySQL and PhpMyAdmin...

Shell script time! (This I did for my friends at the bootcamp)
```sh
MYSQLCONTAINER='mysql'
MYSQLPASSWORD='mypassword123' # MUST CHANGE
PHPMYADMINCONTAINER='mysql-phpmyadmin'
PHPMYADMINPORT=9000

docker run \
    --name $MYSQLCONTAINER \
    -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$MYSQLPASSWORD \
    -p 3306:3306 \
    -d \
    mysql
docker run \
    --name $PHPMYADMINCONTAINER \
    --link $MYSQLCONTAINER:db \
    -p $PHPMYADMINPORT:80 \
    -d \
    phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
```

Cuz I'm a vimmer I also had to set this up with dadbod ofc!

After a lot of trouble with
`ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/tmp/mysql.sock'`
[this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56072820/11917764) guy saved me! I forgot to bind
port 3306 when doing `docker run`


So...

 1. Install `sudo pacman -S mysql` (I got the MariaDB drivers)
 2. Add the database to `g:dbs` (localhost doesn't work for some reason, go with ipv4):

```vim
let g:dbs = {
\   'mysql': 'mysql://username:password@127.0.0.1:3306'
\}
```
