### Not much rly

Today we talked about databases in class. NoSQL databases to be more specific. A
little about the theory, nothing in particular that I didn't knew before.

What I did in the meanwhile was program a little viml, I had issues syncing my
vimrc across multiple computers and after a while I decided to rely on
checkhealt to look for dependencies and wanr me about missing featurs so I will
be able to install themn the way I like in each particular system.
