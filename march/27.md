#### Intro in golang

I know some golang, but decided to take some classes on it.

Thing I learned today:
 - What is `ToString()` in other lanugages, in golang is just `String()`
 - `defer` keyword delays function call till end of current scope. Amazing for `defer file.Close()`.
 - Maps are natively multithreaded. `for k, v in range map` doesn't print items in order.
 - `interface{}` is the base of everything. Kinda like `object` class.
 - Need libraries or frameworks? [Awesome-Go](https://awesome-go.com/)!

I'm extremely disapointed, Platzi said the platform was free for 48hs but I can't claim
my certificate after hitting 30/30 on their test unless I pay for the anual subscription...

I guess I'm not doing any more classes today BUT I had two project ideas. One is a vim plugin
for flexing and the other is an internal tool for MeLi; may ask the security and data team
before atempting to do anything tho.

### Vim plugin

What I said a couple lines above, [vim-flex](https://github.com/eruizc-dev/vim-flex) is real!
Took me a while to figure out some thigns about vim pluggins but I did it!

Now I can `:Flex` whenever someone's watching my screen
