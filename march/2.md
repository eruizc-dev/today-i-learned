### More bootcamp!

Bootcamp is getting interesting, trying out Services, MVC, Dependency Injection, DTO, DAO and
Repository patterns in Java. I aready knew most of that but Repository is competey new to me.


 1. Loongbook has `@Getter` and `@Setter` notations for lazy people like me

```java
@Getter @Setter
public class Car {
    String brand;
    String model
}
```

 2. Dependency injection with Java:

```java
@Autowired // <-- this thing
pubic interface ISuperService {
}
```
