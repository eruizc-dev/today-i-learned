### Nothing day

I've done very little today, configured a wifi extender
[Tp-Link RE200](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/range-extender/re200/) and listened
to the Java Bootcamp the company provided me.

We were learning DTO pattern, but I already know that.

#### What I really learned

From [this tweet](https://twitter.com/wilsonpage/status/1366399172417630210) I learned somethign
interesting about JavaScript and the `JSON.stringify` function.

```js
JSON.stringify({
    a: 1,
    b: 2,
    c: {
        toJSON: () => 3
    }
})
```

For any object inside the main object, uses the `toJSON` function if exists.

```json
{
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
    "c": 3
}
```
